I’ve since used Mapbox to create maps for independent projects I’ve worked on free.

    "text": "Methodology\n\nEstimating N from Wastewater: Sourced publicly available data, as well as data from partner organizations in the Mesoamerican reef region, on hotel and other tourist accommodation locations, watershed boundaries, pourpoints, population densities, and access to wastewater treatment types (UNICEF) for an area spanning from Mexico to Honduras. (Fig 1)\nEstimating N from Agriculture and Livestock: I collaborated with the team behind the fantastic paper paper to acquire spatial crop and livestock production data. I replicated their methods for estimating N generated from each unit area of production, which was based on Fertilizer input data from the FAO and type and area of production (SPAMM). See Halpern et al (2021) for more details.\nEstimating N from Cruise ships: I used AIS ship tracking data shared by Global Fishing Watch to identify location of cruise ships present in the region in a 1 year time span. This data also allowed me to estimate how many days cruiseships spent in the MAR. I used web scraping (via Wikipedia) to generate a dataset listing active cruiseships and their human capacity, and matched ship vessel numbers to the spatial data, to ID each ship that passed through my study area in space and time. I used the capacity of the ship to estimate how much wastewater effluent each might be producing, and therefore how much Nitrogen each ship might add to the wastewater system in the watershed where it was docked, by offloading its waste*\nModeling pollution impact area in the nearshore marine environment:\n\nI quantified the amount of N from the above three sources at the approximate location the N pollution was generated, and then used a raster depicting location of surface waters (including rivers, streams, wetlands) to filter out any pollution that occured further than 1 km from a water source. This is a very “rough” way of estimating watershed transport dynamics, but I consulted a few experts and confirmed it was satisfactory for our purposes.\nI summarized N pollution within 1 km of surface waters by watershed, then assigned that amount to the corresponding pour point. I used a diffusion equation developed by Tuhloske et al in to then estimate the extent of the spatial “plume” that would result in nearshore coastal waters. Note: this script was shared with me and was written using GRASS cli. I amended and customized the script to support iterative analyses, building a loop around it. This was a major learning experience.\n\nAssessing habitat impact: I used publicly available spatial data on the spatial extent of three key marine habitats in the region: coral reefs, sea grasses, and mangroves. I intersected these with my N “plume” maps to estimate what area percentage of each habitat might be impacted by N pollution (ie Nitrogen enrichment)"
